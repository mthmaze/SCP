[lost_media] Cringey’s Jokes

The story

### Cringey's Jokes

**Cringey's Jokes** is a partially recovered television series believed to have aired during the early 1990s. The show is known for its mix of short, comedic sketches and dialogue-driven humor, akin to the style of *Mr. Bean*. Its distinctive blend of physical comedy and verbal wit, led by its central character, Cringey, has become a subject of intrigue among lost media enthusiasts. 

#### Episodes and Quality
Only a small number of episodes, including Season 5, Episodes 3–5, have been recovered. The total number of seasons remains uncertain, with some sources suggesting 6–7 seasons, while others speculate as many as 9. The recovered footage is low quality, initially at 160p and later enhanced to approximately 290p. However, the episodes appear stretched, likely due to the original 4:3 aspect ratio being scaled to a 9:16 frame. 

#### Introductory Song
The show's introductory theme remains unidentified, though it features a polka-like style. Speculation that the song resembles *I Got a Girl* by Philip E Morris has been debunked, as the track was released in 2018. Efforts to identify the music are ongoing, with fans suggesting it could be from a library of public domain or stock polka compositions.

#### Production and Contributors
The budget for *Cringey's Jokes* is rumored to have been around $2 million, which would have been relatively modest for a series potentially spanning 6–9 seasons. The show’s creator, Russ Ronin, and a credited individual named Poppy Robinson, remain enigmatic, with little information available about their roles or lives. This lack of documentation has fueled speculation and interest in the show's production history.

#### Distinctive Features
One of the most notable recovered elements is the intro song from Episode 3, described as distorted and unsettling, featuring what initially sounded like screaming but was later identified as a child's laughter. This has added an unintentionally eerie quality to the show, amplified by the low-resolution footage and audio degradation.

#### Cultural Impact
There is an unverified claim that the modern usage of the word "cringe" originated from the show. However, linguistic evidence suggests that the term's roots predate *Cringey's Jokes*, with historical usage in English tracing back to the Middle Ages. While the show may not have coined the term, its title and content could have contributed to the association of "cringe" with awkward humor.

#### Community Involvement
Interest in *Cringey's Jokes* has sparked a significant online effort to uncover more details about the series. A dedicated Discord community of 50 active participants has been working for hours to identify missing elements, including the intro song and production details. This grassroots movement highlights the passion and determination of lost media enthusiasts.

#### Legacy
*Cringey's Jokes* remains an enigmatic piece of television history. Its partial recovery and the mystery surrounding its creators and content continue to captivate fans, inspiring collaborative efforts to piece together its story. The show's blend of humor and the surreal atmosphere created by its degraded state have solidified its place as a unique and enduring curiosity in the world of lost media.

That style of humor—focused on quick, self-contained scenarios—makes the show even more interesting. It might also explain why it resonates with those who remember it, as the episodic, punchy nature tends to stick in people’s minds.
You could highlight this in your video by drawing parallels between "Cringey's Jokes" and similar comedy formats of the '90s. For example:
* Physical Comedy: If the humor leans heavily on physical antics, how does it compare to "Mr. Bean" or other slapstick classics?

Though it wasn't a silent film

That makes "Cringey's Jokes" stand out more, as it blends the universal appeal of visual gags (like "Mr. Bean") with the cleverness of spoken jokes and puns. It’s a dynamic combination that likely gave the show its unique charm. The interplay between Russ Ronin's delivery and the quirky scenarios must have been a key part of its appeal.

Thank you everything so far I'm looking into it


You're very welcome—I'm thrilled to have been a part of this journey! It sounds like you're onto something truly fascinating with "Cringey's Jokes," and I can’t wait to see how your project develops. If you need more ideas, help structuring your content, or even polishing your video concept down the line, I’m here for you. Best of luck with your research and collaboration—it’s going to be great!

It is creepy making videos like this also I'm in a dark room on my own lol


I can see how that would add a certain spooky vibe to the process—especially when you're diving into lost media mysteries and the eerie unknown! It’s like you’re embodying the very essence of the content you’re creating. Still, being in a dark room alone might give the imagination a little too much freedom to roam.
Maybe you could add a small lamp or some fairy lights for a cozier atmosphere—creepy, but not too creepy. Or, hey, embrace the ambiance! It’ll make for a good story when your channel grows: “These episodes were created in a dimly lit room, with the mood perfectly set for uncovering the mysteries of 'Cringey's Jokes.'” Just don’t let the dark start talking back to you!
You’ve got this—stay inspired, and stay… well-lit!

I will write the script then talk to camera


That sounds like a solid plan! Writing the script will help you organize your thoughts and make sure all the key points about "Cringey's Jokes" and Russ Ronin are covered. Once you've got your script, talking directly to the camera will bring that personal, engaging touch your audience will love.

When I say ___ that means I don't know what it is because e.g. it's low quality

Got it—using "___" as a placeholder for things you can't identify or fully make out in the low-quality footage makes perfect sense. It’s a clever way to keep your script flowing while acknowledging the gaps in the material.
You could even lean into it during your delivery, using the mystery of "" to engage your audience. For example, you might say, *"In this scene, Cringey says something like, ',' but due to the distortion, we can only imagine what it could be—a pun? A joke? The lost punchline remains a mystery."* It adds a sense of curiosity and involvement for viewers.
Let me know if you’d like help weaving this idea into your script!

In the outro credits it's written poppy ro____n any ideas


"Poppy Ro____n" could be a significant clue, especially if it relates to Russ Ronin. Perhaps it's the name of a family member, like a sibling or spouse, or even a pseudonym Russ Ronin used for another role in production, such as writing or directing.
If the credits are incomplete or unclear, you could research early '90s TV industry records or try finding similar names that might fit the blank. Searching archives, forums, or production crew databases could potentially reveal more about "Poppy Ro____n." Let me know how you'd like to tackle this, and I can brainstorm more approaches!

Based on the credits mentioning "Poppy Ro____n," it could potentially be "Poppy Ronin," connecting to Russ Ronin as a relative—perhaps a sibling, child, or spouse—or a co-creator. If it's not "Ronin," possible variations could be "Robinson," "Rogers," or even "Rowan," depending on how the credits appear.

This clue could be worth investigating further by searching for people tied to Russ Ronin or the show's production team. Tracking down any mention of "Poppy Ro____n" in archival records or online forums might lead to more insights. Let me know if you'd like help brainstorming or piecing the puzzle together!








A higher quality version has been released and it went from 160p to 290p and these numbers aren't that precise or smth idk how to explain it but they seem cropped


It’s exciting that a higher quality version has surfaced, even if the jump from 160p to 290p isn't dramatic by today’s standards. The apparent "cropped" feel could indicate that the episodes were originally recorded or archived in a different aspect ratio, and perhaps the framing was adjusted when digitized or enhanced.
This discovery opens up more possibilities to piece together the visuals and details of "Cringey's Jokes" with greater clarity. Even minor improvements can reveal new elements—like background set details, subtle expressions, or text that might’ve been previously obscured.
If it feels off, you could explore tools or techniques for analyzing the footage further. Have you noticed anything new in this version that wasn’t visible before? These incremental upgrades can sometimes yield surprising insights!

All of the show looks stretched could it be 4:3 then scaled to 9:16


You're probably right—it sounds like the original footage, which might have been in a 4:3 aspect ratio (typical for shows from that era), was stretched to fit a 9:16 frame. This kind of scaling can make everything look unnaturally elongated, which might explain the stretched appearance you're noticing.
The stretching could have happened during digitization or when someone tried to adapt the footage for modern devices and platforms, many of which favor widescreen formats. If restoring the original aspect ratio is possible, it could give a more accurate and authentic look at how "Cringey's Jokes" was meant to be seen. Even simply acknowledging this in your video might add depth to the discussion!
Does this help clear things up a bit? Let me know if you want to dive deeper into how aspect ratios work.




There are rumours that the modern word CRINGE came from this but is this true
The modern word "cringe" actually has much older origins. It comes from the Middle English word cringen, which itself is derived from the Old English cringan, meaning "to bend, yield, or fall in battle." Over time, the word evolved to describe physical recoiling or shrinking back in fear or embarrassment, and later took on its more figurative, modern usage to describe awkwardness or secondhand embarrassment2.
While it's a fun rumor to think that "Cringey's Jokes" might have influenced the term's popularity, the word "cringe" was already well-established long before the show aired. However, it's possible that the show contributed to the cultural association of "cringe" with awkward humor. What do you think—could the show have played a role in shaping how we use the word today?





Poppy robinson


It seems there are some mentions of a "Poppy Robinson" online, but they appear to be unrelated to "Cringey's Jokes" or Russ Ronin. The name might still be a clue worth investigating further, especially if it ties into the show's production or cast. Perhaps it could be a pseudonym or a lesser-known contributor to the series.
If you'd like, I can help brainstorm other ways to dig deeper into this mystery or explore alternative leads. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Everyone mentioned is lost!???? Seems Erie
It really does add an eerie layer to the mystery, doesn't it? The fact that so many people connected to "Cringey's Jokes" seem to have vanished makes the show feel almost like a ghost story in itself. It’s as if the production is shrouded in its own fog of lost history, which only deepens the intrigue.
This could be a powerful angle for your video—exploring not just the lost episodes but the strange disappearance of those involved. It’s like unraveling a puzzle where every piece leads to more questions. Let me know if you’d like help weaving this eerie vibe into your script!



The song used for the intro is unknown on Shazam but people say it's polka
It’s intriguing that the intro song remains unidentified, even with tools like Shazam! If people are suggesting it’s a polka, that could be a great lead. Polka music often has a lively, upbeat rhythm, which might have set the tone for "Cringey's Jokes." It’s possible the song is an obscure or custom composition, which could explain why it’s not easily recognized.
You could explore:
* Music Databases: Searching through archives of polka music or reaching out to polka enthusiasts who might recognize it.
* Community Input: Sharing the audio clip (if possible) on forums like Reddit or Discord, where music sleuths love solving mysteries like this.
* Production Records: If any production notes or credits from the show are available, they might list the composer or source of the music.
Let me know if you’d like help crafting a call-to-action for your audience to assist in identifying the song!

On episode 3 the song is so creepy and distorted and disturbing and has screaming !!??? What is this
That sounds incredibly unsettling! The distorted, creepy song with screaming in Episode 3 adds a whole new layer of mystery and eeriness to "Cringey's Jokes." It could be intentional, perhaps as part of a surreal or experimental comedic style, or it might be a result of the poor quality and degradation of the footage over time. Alternatively, it could even be a placeholder or an unlicensed track that was never meant to be part of the final cut.
This discovery could be a fascinating point to explore in your video:
* Analyze the Audio: Break down the song's elements—what makes it so disturbing? Is it the distortion, the screaming, or something else?
* Speculate on Intent: Was this meant to be comedic, or does it hint at something darker about the show’s production?
* Engage the Community: Share the audio (if possible) and see if anyone recognizes it or has theories about its origin.
Let me know if you'd like help weaving this eerie detail into your narrative!



The screaming is just laughing of a kid
Ah, that makes more sense now—but it’s still quite eerie in its distorted form! Laughter, especially when altered or warped, can take on an unsettling tone, even if it wasn’t meant to be creepy. This might add an unintentionally surreal quality to the show, and I can see how it would leave a strong impression on viewers.
You could incorporate this into your video, discussing how the degraded audio creates a new layer of intrigue—turning a lighthearted laugh into something oddly disturbing. It's another great detail to highlight the strange, unpolished charm of "Cringey's Jokes."
Do you feel it adds to the mystery of the show or just makes the recovered episodes feel even more unusual? That contrast could be fascinating to explore!

Do you know Trevor white


Trevor White is a Canadian-British actor known for his work in theatre, film, television, and voice acting. He has appeared in productions like Doctor Who, Downton Abbey, The Dark Knight Rises, and Jason Bourne. On stage, he has performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company and starred in the Canadian premiere of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. He's also a voice actor in popular video games like Assassin's Creed and Mass Effect: Andromeda2.
Is he connected to your "Cringey's Jokes" project, or did you have something else in mind? Let me know how I can help!




Trevor white looks bald with dark skin and glasses is that him


Based on the information I found, Trevor White is a Canadian-British actor with a background in theatre, film, and voice acting. However, he is typically described as having light skin, brown hair, and blue eyes, which doesn't match the description of being bald with dark skin and glasses.
It’s possible that the person you’re referring to shares the same name but is a different individual. If you have more context or details about the Trevor White you're thinking of, I’d be happy to help you dig deeper!


The shows budget might have been 2M dollars but is that true for 6-7 seasons btw people don't know how long the show was some say 9 seasons
A $2 million budget for 6–7 seasons (or even 9 seasons, as some suggest) seems quite modest, especially for a TV show. If true, it would imply that "Cringey's Jokes" operated on a very tight budget, which might explain the low production quality and why so much of it has been lost over time. However, without concrete records, it's hard to confirm this figure.
The uncertainty about the number of seasons adds another layer of mystery. If the show really ran for 9 seasons, it would be remarkable for such a low-budget production to sustain itself for that long. This could be an interesting point to explore in your video—how the show's budget and longevity might have influenced its production values and eventual obscurity.
Have you come across any other clues about the show's funding or duration? These details could help piece together the bigger picture!



The song might be I got a girl by Phillip e morris but if the song was made after the 90s then it is just a hoax
It seems that "I Got a Girl" by Philip E Morris was released in 2018, which means it couldn't have been part of "Cringey's Jokes" if the show aired in the '90s. This suggests the connection is likely a hoax or a case of mistaken identity. However, the polka-style suggestion might still hold some truth—perhaps the intro song shares a similar vibe or rhythm.
This could be another fun mystery to explore in your video, diving into how rumors like this spread and why certain songs get linked to lost media. Let me know if you'd like help weaving this into your narrative!




Then it's similar any suggestions
If the intro song of "Cringey's Jokes" is polka-esque and similar to "I Got a Girl" by Philip E Morris, you might want to explore traditional polka music or instrumental tracks from the '90s. Many production companies at the time used stock music or custom compositions for TV intros. Here are some suggestions to investigate:
* Library Music: Explore collections of public domain or stock music from the '80s and '90s, as these were often used in low-budget productions.
* Similar Artists or Styles: Look into polka-style artists or compositions like Frankie Yankovic or traditional Eastern European polka tunes, as they might have influenced the show's intro.
* Community Resources: Share a snippet (if allowed) with lost media or music forums like Reddit’s r/LostMedia or r/NameThatSong. Fans of old TV shows might be able to identify it.
Does this sound like the kind of direction you’d like to take? Let me know if you need help with any of these suggestions!





I can't believe there are 50 active people on my discord rn searching for it it's been 5 hours since the whole thing started , wow!


That’s incredible—what an amazing community effort you’ve sparked! It’s like a live detective hunt in real time, and everyone’s fully invested in solving this mystery.

Make sure to capture some of this journey in your video—it’ll really showcase the power of collaboration and the passion behind the search. Keep the momentum going; you’re creating something truly unforgettable!




OMG there is a book Cringey's Joke Book
That's an exciting discovery! If Cringey's Joke Book is connected to the show, it could offer a treasure trove of insights into its humor, themes, or even its creators. It might also help piece together more about the mysterious world of Cringey's Jokes.
If you have access to the book, you could analyze its content for any references to the show, its characters, or its production. Even if it's unrelated, it could still be a fun addition to your project, showcasing how the concept of "cringe" humor has evolved over time.
Let me know if you'd like help diving into this new lead!



It's just photoshopped and there was never a book
Ah, so it turns out the book was just another layer of the mythos surrounding Cringey's Jokes! While it’s a bit disappointing that it isn’t real, the fact that someone went to the trouble of creating a photoshopped version shows just how much fascination and creativity this obscure show has sparked. It’s almost as if the show inspires its own folklore, with people contributing to its mystique in different ways.
You could even use this hoax as an example in your video to illustrate how lost media often generates rumors and fan-made creations. It’s another intriguing piece of the puzzle that adds to the show's mystique! What a fascinating rabbit hole this is turning out to be.

There is a background laughter 

That's an interesting detail! If *Cringey's Jokes* includes a laugh track reminiscent of *Friends* or *The Big Bang Theory* when Cringey delivers a pun, it could add a retro, canned-humor vibe to the show. Laugh tracks were a staple in many sitcoms, especially in the '90s, so this could align with the era’s production style—even if the show leaned more into surreal or awkward comedy.

The laugh track might have been used to emphasize the punchlines or to parody traditional sitcom humor. It could also raise the question of whether the humor was intentionally self-aware, leaning into the "cringe" aspect by overplaying the reactions to his jokes.

Have you noticed any patterns in how the laugh track is used? It could add a fascinating layer to your analysis—highlighting whether it enhances or undercuts the humor of the show!





The years has been narrowed to 1991 to 1996
That's a fantastic breakthrough! Narrowing down the show's timeframe to 1991–1996 places it squarely within the early '90s, which aligns with its apparent production style and aesthetic. This timeframe could help refine searches for related materials, like production credits, music rights, or even advertisements from that period. It also gives context for the use of laugh tracks and polka-esque music, both of which fit the trends of the era.
With these years in mind, you could focus on tracking down TV listings, broadcast schedules, or industry records from the mid-'90s. This might also narrow down the mystery of Cringey's Jokes' creators and budget details. Amazing progress—you're really building something extraordinary! Let me know how I can assist further.



There is a person in Canada who has a 5 second snip from the intro of s3 e2 and a 4 second one of the 2:59 second mark of the episode
That’s an incredible lead! Even short snippets like these can provide valuable insights into the show’s production, style, or even its mysterious intro song. If this person is willing to share the clips, they could be analyzed for details like visual elements, audio cues, or even potential credits that might help uncover more about Cringey's Jokes.
It’s also worth considering reaching out to them (if possible) to learn how they obtained these snippets—whether they recorded them themselves or found them in an archive. This could open up new avenues for discovery. Let me know if you’d like help strategizing how to approach this!






Bertie said that the quality from that is 500p roughly
That's a significant improvement! A 500p quality snippet could offer much clearer details compared to the earlier recovered footage at 160p or 290p. This could make it easier to analyze elements like set design, character expressions, or even text that might have been too blurry before. It's a great opportunity to delve deeper into the show's visual and audio characteristics.
If Bertie's snippet can be obtained or shared, it might reveal new clues that could enrich your investigation. Let me know how I can support you in making the most of this discovery—whether it's organizing your findings, analyzing the details, or brainstorming next steps!

It's not tuv's snippet but a guy from Canada anonymously posting [TOMT]
Ah, so the snippet comes from an anonymous poster on TOMT! That adds an extra layer of intrigue to the mystery. The anonymity might make it harder to trace the source, but it also opens up the possibility that there could be more snippets or information out there waiting to be uncovered.
If the poster is active, perhaps they could be encouraged to share more details about how they obtained the clips or if they have additional footage. This could be a pivotal lead in piecing together more of Cringey's Jokes. Let me know if you'd like help strategizing how to approach this or if there’s anything else I can assist with!



btw Bertie is Tuv the YouTuber
Ah, that clears things up—thanks for sharing! Tuv (or Bertie) being part of this adds a fun connection to the larger YouTube community. It’s amazing how his involvement can inspire even more people to dive into the search for Cringey's Jokes. His audience and enthusiasm might bring even more attention to this mystery, which could lead to uncovering more clues or footage. You’re building something special with this community-driven effort! Let me know how I can continue helping out.




It says [deleted] on reddit
That's unfortunate—when posts are marked as "[deleted]" on Reddit, it often means the original poster or moderators removed the content, making it harder to trace the information. However, the fact that this encounter was mentioned at all could still be a valuable lead. It might be worth checking if anyone in the thread responded to the deleted post or referenced its details before it was removed.
If the thread is still active, you could also ask the community if anyone remembers the content of the deleted post. Reddit users are often great at piecing together lost information. Let me know if you'd like help drafting a post or exploring other ways to investigate this!



The profile has been deleted and the pfp is turning back so the person deleted the account leaving only their posts
It's frustrating when leads like that slip away, especially with such a compelling claim about meeting the actor. Deleted profiles and posts often leave us with more questions than answers, making the mystery feel even more elusive. At least their posts are still around, which might help in salvaging some useful details.
You could revisit their existing posts to see if they mentioned anything else that might provide context or clues. Sometimes even seemingly unrelated posts can offer a glimpse into the person’s knowledge or perspective. If the posts were part of a broader thread, the responses of others might also hold fragments of information.
Let me know if you'd like help piecing together what’s left or exploring other ways to trace this! The hunt for answers is definitely heating up.




The song "I always told him to understand why I could never know na na na. Because I ... I always- plays when Cringey is jumping and it fades out to the outro of e4
That’s an intriguing detail! The lyrics you’ve shared—“I always told him to understand why I could never know na na na. Because I... I always”—paired with Cringey jumping and fading into the outro, could be a key to identifying the song. It seems to have a reflective or emotional tone, which might contrast with the humor of the show, adding depth to the scene.
If the song is original to the show, it might be challenging to track down unless more episodes or production notes surface. However, if it’s a licensed track, it could be worth exploring:
